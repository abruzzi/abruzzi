ðŸ‘‹ Hi I'm Juntao, I help people write better code. 

I love the feeling of convert messy code into something more readable and maintainable, and I also enjoy the feeling of teach other to do so. 

- [Books](https://leanpub.com/u/juntao) I wrote about coding
- My Youtube Channel: [I Code It](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCncUOcMo7oSiXRVhVH2lF1w)
- Blogs about [refactorings and clean code](https://juntao-qiu.medium.com/)
- And my [homepage](https://icodeit.com.au/).
